The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you attempt to access a database path that doesn't exist, or if you try to perform an operation on a document that doesn't exist. This can be tricky to debug because the error messages aren't always super clear.  For example, attempting to read a document with a non-existent path will result in a null value, which can silently propagate through your code causing unexpected behavior later.
